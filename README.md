# BssentialsX 
BssentialsX version 3.x is a rewrite of Essentials made to be more optimized & fix alot of bugs.

## What is Bssentials
Bssentials is a total remake of Essentials from the ground up.
We do our best to provide a great remake of Essentials.

## Why use Bssentials instead of EssentialsX?
Essentials was created 8 years ago, and the codebase is a mess.
So such a mess with unnessary code, that it took EssentialsX a long time for the 1.13 changes.
Essentials is also filled with proformance issues & bad practices.

Remaking Essentials from the ground up also gives us the ability for better proformance & less resource-intensive,
with newer functionaly.

## BssentialsX Version
BssentialsX Version is BssentialsX 3.0.1-dev+00-SNAPSHOT

## Building
To Build with Maven, use the command ```mvn package```
To build with Eclipse simply make sure you have the ```Spigot-API.jar``` added to the classpath & export normaly.

## Compatability
i am sure that BssentialsX Can Work With EssentialsX.

## Dependency
Use github package to launch this guy!
